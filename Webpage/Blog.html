                                Hypertext is a relatively well-known term nowadays. There is still debate about what the term hypertext actually means though. The term began with Theodor Holm (“Ted”) Nelson, along with hypermedia and various other related terms.

                                What is semantic markup? Semantic markup is using HTML in such a way as to make your webpage more meaningful. Semantic HTML is not visible to the user when accessing the webpage as CSS determines the styling, but it is very important to non-visual users. You can avoid using semantic HTML, but your webpage will not have any meaning to those users. Semantic HTML should not be used for styling, only to convey meaning.

                                What is accessibility? Accessibility refers to the ability to access various places, services, etc. by everyone, especially for people with disabilities. Examples of accessibility in public are: elevators/ramps for people with physical and mobility impairments, braille and beeping from traffic lights for blind people, etc. When referring to accessibility online, we are referring to the ability to access web content by people with disabilities, who make use of things such as screen readers or subtitles.

                                “Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places.” In this statement, the word geography refers to multiple things in relation to information. There is geography in the sense that all information originates from somewhere. Information is about geographical places around the world (and beyond that as well).

                                Gender inequality is a big problem in today’s society, and this inequality appears in technological environments as well. A well-documented example is the inequality between men and women, but other genders experience other forms of inequality not often discussed, as they are often forgotten or left out entirely. I will be discussing some of the issues and inequalities experienced by women, and by extension gender non-conforming people.
