                    Hypertext is a relatively well-known term nowadays. There is still debate about what the term hypertext actually means though. The term began with Theodor Holm (“Ted”) Nelson, along with hypermedia and various other related terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the literary community, hypertext is described as the “hyperlinks” which link passages of text together. By clicking on a hyperlink, you are directed to the linked text. This new passage replaces the previous passages, which can usually be returned to by clicking the back button (where one is provided).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are however different (and sometimes contradicting) definitions found elsewhere. In the computer science community one description is “hypertext-as-interaction with information to build associations, and through associations to build knowledge.” This refers not only to linking passages, but also using hyperlinks to connect passages that contain related or otherwise relevant information. This can be used to efficiently navigate a specific topic, as any other information you may need that is not already included in the open passage may be accessed via hyperlinks, thus building knowledge and making that knowledge more accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nelson defined hypertext as “a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.” Nelson was thinking about what could be possible with the invention of file structures such as the ELF (Evolutionary List File) that is not possible, or not easily achieved, using physical forms of media. He also believed this could be done with more than just text, as hyperfilm also falls under the umbrella term hypermedia. Hypermedia would be a new form of media that is not only consumed in the same way as other media, but also allows and even encourages people to interact with it in some form or another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Nelson, “Responding resources are of two types: facilities and hyper-media.” Facilities refer to interactive and responsive tools, such as word processors, graph plotters, spreadsheets, etc. These tools only perform operations on what you enter, and are not a form of media. Hypermedia is different from standard media due to users being able to interact with the contents of the media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nelson describes hypermedia as “branching or performing presentations”. With standard media, there is usually a single route from start to finish. Using hypermedia, there will still usually be a main route, but using hyperlinks you are able to branch off and explore other routes. You may decide to return back to the original route, or you may decide one of the branches is a better route to follow. Unlike standard media, there may not be a finish at all in hypermedia. You can define your own finish (for example at the end of a specific article), but you may end up going down a rabbit hole of information before then and forget about where you started entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nelson also stated that the hypermedia systems will be “designed, written, drawn and edited, by authors, artists, designers and editors”. Again, this is what differentiates hypermedia from the facilities mentioned earlier, and is why hypermedia is a form of media. Hypermedia is created in a similar manner to standard media, but is called hypermedia due to its “multi-dimensional” nature once links of some kind have been added. Facilities are not a form of media, but may be used to assist the creation of media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nelson believed that the hypermedia systems would not be programmed. He intended for humans to be the ones to make decisions about which information is related and should be connected, and then for those people to make that connection (for example, by using a hyperlink). This system will form an ever-growing, and ever-changing, web of linked information. By attempting to program these connections, the same keywords may be found, but there is no guarantee that the information found will be relevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Discrete hypertext” and “stretchtext” are two different forms of hypertext. Discrete hypertext (or “chunk style” hypertext) falls under the branching half of Nelson’s hypertext description “branching or performing presentations”. This form of hypertext is widely used, and is recognized as hyperlinks. By clicking on a link, the current passage on screen gets replaced with a new passage, and returns once you go back. You can travel down branches from the main passage, but in order to travel down other branches you must return to the main passage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Stretchtext” falls under the performing half of Nelson’s description. Unlike discrete hypertext, stretchtext doesn’t move away from the current passage. Essentially it works in a similar manner to how we view digital pictures nowadays: if you zoom in, you see more detail, and if you zoom out, you see less detail. Stretchtext allows you to increase or decrease the level of detail in a passage, probably adding in detail in places where hyperlinks may have been used instead. There is only one passage, but this passage changes and responds to the user as they want more or less detail shown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Returning to what was discussed earlier, in the literary community hypertext almost exclusively refers to discrete hypertext nowadays. In the hypertext research community the focus is on knowledge work using tools that Nelson may have considered facilities. The internet as we know it today would mostly fall under the definition used in the literary community, as hyperlinks are an incredibly common sight and are taken for granted as they appear almost everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nelson saw the possibilities created with the development of digital filing systems. When using analog filing systems, you would potentially have to search through many files in order to find connected information. By creating digital links between related information, you skip the tedious task of searching through unrelated information in order to find what you are looking for, if you find it at all. A very basic example is one we have probably all experienced. In school, we all had dictionaries, and if we didn’t know a word we had to find it in the dictionary to learn its meaning. It’s a very simple example, as the ‘filing’ system itself is very simple, but there is still that process of searching for a specific word. Nowadays if we are reading an article and we don’t know a word, we can simply google it, or click on a hyperlink if one is provided, and if we don’t understand another word in that definition we can google it again if there isn’t already a hyperlink attached to that word. Google itself has made finding documents easier, as a search shows all results that may be related, even if the information you are looking for is buried in other articles. Using an analog filing system, you may not find those articles at all as they most likely won’t be filed under the appropriate category due to their titles.

                    Before reading this article, I had never heard of stretchtext before. I found it an incredibly interesting form of hypertext – once I had actually managed to find it on google, as searching for “stretchtext” initially only came up with ways to make your text appear narrower or wider. It’s a practical way for you to get the explanations you need without having to move away from the article entirely. Because of the ability to read articles with more or less detail, I think it would be similar to reading the abstract before reading the rest of an article. If you find the abstract, or in this case the less detailed version of an article, to be interesting, you can then read the rest of the article, or the more detailed version of an article. There may also be intermediate versions of an article using stretchtext. I think this could be similar to reading an old book, or an abridged version of the book, or an even more abridged version of the book designed for children. At first I could not think of a single example online where I had seen stretchtext being used, but after some thinking I realized I had actually seen it in different forms. Last year I started playing D&D, and our group has been using dndbeyond.com for our character sheets and campaigns. Dndbeyond uses a hybrid of stretchtext and discrete hypertext. Hovering your mouse over certain areas gives brief descriptions of what that specific thing is, and clicking on others expands on that thing entirely. Even the hyperlinks act differently to normal hyperlinks though, as the new information doesn’t replace the passage, but instead opens a bar on the side of the screen where the new information is displayed. This seems like a very practical idea to me, as people don’t always want to move away from what they are busy with, but don’t have a choice in the matter. The only way around this is to open links in a new tab if they are using a web browser, but this is not always a practical option either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second place I thought of that uses a form of stretchtext is very well-known, but didn’t come to mind immediately as text is a much smaller part of this example. Google maps, or any similar map apps, are extremely practical because they use stretchtext in a manner that feels very natural to users. As you may know, you can easily search for a specific place, but if you are just looking around you can not only move around location-wise, but also zoom in and out. Starting from being zoomed out, the ‘passage’ shows very little information, usually only continent names and ocean names. Zooming in, the ‘passage’ begins to get more detailed: country names appear, then more and more city names, major road names, and area names. At the most zoomed in and detailed level, you can see all street names and even property lines.
                </p>

                    I think Nelson would be interested to see how popular hypermedia has become, but also disappointed that some forms of hypermedia have almost been forgotten. Discrete hypertext makes life incredibly easy for us thanks to the work of many people to link information together and grow the linked hypermedia system. It would be great to see stretchtext more commonly used though, as it is also extremely practical and would feel very natural to users as most people are already used to using a mouse wheel or two fingers to zoom in and out of things on pcs and mobile devices respectively. I believe it could become relatively popular, as people often want to stay on a specific website or continue a specific article. Websites also might not want you to leave that website, so stretchtext may encourage people to remain there instead of using hyperlinks to travel to other websites. Currently the only way I can think of for them to avoid this is to make sure that hyperlinks open the new website in a different tab so that their website remains open; again, not a very practical method.
                </p>

                    I ended up writing what I think is a lot about this article, even though I had only read it for curiosity’s sake and intended to choose a different reading to write about. Like in the article “As we may think”, it is amazing to read about how Bush and Nelson were both looking to the future and imagining solutions to problems people may have, even though they were focused on different topics. Discrete hypertext appears everywhere, but sometimes goes against what Nelson had hoped for as the creation of hyperlinks can be programmed without input from a human in some situations. It would be sad to see stretchtext disappear entirely, along with other forms of hypermedia that have all but been forgotten. Hopefully in the future stretchtext, and possibly other smaller forms of hypermedia, become more common.
