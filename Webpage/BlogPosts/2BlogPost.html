                <h3>
                    What is semantic markup?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup is using HTML in such a way as to make your webpage more meaningful. Semantic HTML is not visible to the user when accessing the webpage as CSS determines the styling, but it is very important to non-visual users. You can avoid using semantic HTML, but your webpage will not have any meaning to those users. Semantic HTML should not be used for styling, only to convey meaning.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What makes semantic markup different?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup doesn’t care about styling. It is used to develop a proper hierarchy between elements, which creates more meaning. By not using semantic elements, you can organize elements better using HTML only, but problems can arise later on during styling and eventually for non-visual users.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What are the benefits to using semantic markup?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic markup has many pros, and takes only very slightly more effort to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first benefit is it makes your webpage more accessible to machine users such as web browsers or search engine crawlers. They are able to read the hierarchy of the website, and find important items such as headings and keywords very quickly, rather than important information being included with other information. This results in search engine optimization (SEO).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next benefit is that your webpage becomes accessible to a much wider range of people. Translating your webpage becomes significantly easier. It also allows people with disabilities to access your page easily. People with visual impairments usually use screen readers, and if there is no hierarchy your information will all blend together, making it very difficult for them to understand. They also won’t be able to understand images if they do not have some sort of description, and components such as buttons may not be found by the user. It is also a good idea to have captions of some kind in videos for auditory impaired users. Your website should be kept as simple as possible as well, as this will also aid people with cognitive impairments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using semantic elements also makes your code easier to understand for other people, keeps your code neat and meaningful, and makes maintaining your code easy. Using CSS to style your webpage also becomes easier, as it is easier to target all instances of specific elements rather than having to create IDs for every element and referring to each one.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using semantic elements in your HTML documents requires very little extra input on your behalf, and has many benefits for that little bit of extra thought. It is much better for you to use semantic elements for yourself and others.
