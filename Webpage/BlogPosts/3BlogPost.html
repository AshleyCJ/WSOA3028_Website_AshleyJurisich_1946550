                <h3>
                    What is accessibility?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Accessibility refers to the ability to access various places, services, etc. by everyone, especially for people with disabilities. Examples of accessibility in public are: elevators/ramps for people with physical and mobility impairments, braille and beeping from traffic lights for blind people, etc. When referring to accessibility online, we are referring to the ability to access web content by people with disabilities, who make use of things such as screen readers or subtitles.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why is web accessibility important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    According to a 2011 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of the world’s population (about 1 billion people) live with some type of disability. This means that many people may require assistive devices when accessing the web, and inaccessible websites result in the exclusion of these people. In most places it is illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities, and this can extend to online platforms as well. Many countries have laws in place that require business websites to be accessible, and there are many cases where companies have been sued for not complying to these laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having an accessible website as a business is very beneficial. You are expanding your audience by including people with disabilities, and may therefore bring in more customers than businesses with inaccessible websites. You would also be building a better reputation than other businesses because people will feel included and cared for, bringing in even more customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making websites more accessible also tends to make your website more user-friendly for the general population by making use of clear headings, image descriptions, etc. and allowing the screen to easily be adjusted to be viewed on mobile devices or for users making use of screen magnifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By having a good HTML framework, you are improving your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) which makes your website easier to find. This structure is also important for people using screen readers. Having a good framework also makes maintenance of your website significantly easier, with minimal effort required if a good structure is created from the start.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What types of disabilities should we consider?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    People with visual impairments: this refers to people who are blind, have limited vision, are colourblind, or generally struggle reading small text (typically older people). These people may make use of screen readers or screen magnifiers, which makes it necessary to have a proper HTML structure for screen readers to comprehend. Rescaling the screen or zooming in should not be a difficult task for users who need it. You should not rely on colour alone for your website navigation, use it with other methods such as making it bold or a different shape. When using pictures or videos, make sure there is a detailed description attached to them so that people with visual impairments will know what a sighted person would be seeing. Having good colour, font and image choices, and avoid flashing lights and harsh colour combinations, will also benefit people who are sensitive to light (such as people with epilepsy) and will also improve the experience of the rest of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with auditory impairments: people who are deaf or hard of hearing rely on text rather than audio. They require transcripts for podcasts, and captions for videos. Many people with good hearing also prefer to use captions when watching videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with speech requirements: I am referring to 2 groups of people here. The first is the group of people who cannot speak, and require alternate forms of communication to phoning companies and people, such as emailing or texting instead. The second is for people who cannot type either due to a permanent or temporary condition, and require a website that allows the use of speech to text as well as other forms of input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with mobility impairments: people with physical disabilities such as missing limbs or paralysis also require input methods they can actually make use of, such as one-handed navigation, speech input, etc. This can also refer to people who cannot make use of a mouse, or just don’t have one, and require keyboard-only navigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with cognitive impairments: this refers to people who have things such as intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, mental illnesses, etc. or simply people who struggle with technology in general. To make things easier for these people as well as the rest of the population, it is a good idea to keep your website as simple and easy to navigate as possible. You should only include items that are necessary to your webpage to minimize distractions, and use language that is easy to understand. Keep common elements such as menus and back buttons in places where the user would usually find them.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The four principles of accessibility
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There is a common understanding that there are 4 main principles when it comes to accessibility, using the acronym POUR:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perceivable. This refers to the ability of users to perceive what they are looking at. For those users who have visual impairments, the website should be perceivable by means of sound. They should be able to differentiate between paragraphs, titles, buttons, links, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Operable. This refers to users being able to interact with buttons, links, and other forms of input once they have been identified. Users should be able to navigate using a mouse, keyboard, speech to text, etc. In other words, input should be accepted from multiple different forms of input means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understandable. Your website should be easy to understand. Users should be able to easily navigate your website, and understand how things work and what is expected of them. Elements should be where users expect them to be, and different pages should remain consistent in terms of basic interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robust. Your website should not only be designed for use on computers, but for use on mobile devices and multiple operating systems. Your website should also be able to accept multiple forms of input, such as assistive technologies.
