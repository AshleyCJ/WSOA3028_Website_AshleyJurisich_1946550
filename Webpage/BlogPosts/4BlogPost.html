                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    “Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places.” In this statement, the word geography refers to multiple things in relation to information. There is geography in the sense that all information originates from somewhere. Information is about geographical places around the world (and beyond that as well). As information travels around the world, it can be changed in many different places. There is also geography in a more tangible sense: the hardware used to create networks and store information takes up space in the real world, and has a physical geographical location. All of these definitions of geography have an effect on information. Some places have easier access to information and can have a bigger influence on it, while others have very little to do with information. The paper discusses how uneven geographies of the physical elements of information results in uneven geographies of the digital elements of information.

                <h3>
                    What are (im)mutable augmentations?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    First we need to define mutable and immutable. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, mutable means something is “prone to change” or “capable of change or of being changed”. The definition of immutable is “not capable of or susceptible to change”. Augmentation is “the process of increasing the size, value, or quality of something by adding to it”. So combining these definitions, I would say that immutable augmentations are pieces of information that can be added to, but seldom change once it is added. I would then say that mutable augmentations are pieces of information that can be added to, but also changes regularly as other things change and affect this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information augmentations occur when information is shared around the world. Existing information is always being added to as new things are discovered, created or discussed. This new information could be an entirely new piece of information, or it could be adding information to existing topics to create more detail and explore topics more thoroughly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some methods of sharing information are more mutable than others. An analog example of a mutable augmentation is the sharing of stories through verbal communication. As stories are shared from one person to another, they tend to change as people remember things differently and exaggerate different elements. Legends also tend to change to reflect the values of different cultures, often as an example of morals and the consequences of not following them. Many fairytales told to children have rather gruesome origins, and have simply been watered down to cater to children. A digital example of a mutable augmentation is related to pieces of subjective information found online (such as blog posts about experiences) or news articles that take events or quotes and twist them by either exaggerating facts or taking things out of context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An analog example of an immutable augmentation is printed media. Once something is printed, it will remain that way as it is a permanent augmentation. Notes may be added to it, but the printed information will not change. A digital example would be informational sites that write about factual knowledge. Once something has been proven factual, it very seldom changes as it is shared around the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An interesting example would be translating information into different languages. Even though it appears as though the information has completely changed, and is therefore mutable, the meaning behind it remains the same, adding an element of immutability.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Geographies of access and enablement
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In order for people to receive and participate in gathering knowledge, they need to have access to that information. Before the internet, libraries were the main point of access to information. If you did not have a library to go to, you could not access information as easily. In digital times, one of the easiest ways to interact with information is through internet access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the paper being discussed, it was found that not everyone has equal access to the internet. Asia is the continent that has the most internet users, making up 42% of the world’s internet users at the time of publication. The southern hemisphere has significantly fewer internet users than the northern hemisphere. For the most part, the northern hemisphere also has a significantly higher internet penetration percentage than the southern hemisphere. These statistics mean that the southern hemisphere has significantly less influence on and access to information, as there is less internet access and therefore fewer internet users.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Broadband affordability
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A big factor in internet accessibility is the cost of broadband subscriptions. Some countries have significantly more expensive subscription rates if you are looking at the prices themselves. This is not a fair comparison to make though, as something is only deemed expensive if you compare it to your salary. A better comparison is made in the paper being discussed: the cost of a broadband subscription as a percentage of the average income of that country. It was found that north American countries and Europe have some of the lowest percentages in the world, while many African countries have the highest percentages. In many African countries, the cost of a subscription is more than 50% of that country’s average income, with some countries having a cost greater than the average income. This means that in these countries, only very wealthy people are able to afford broadband access, and therefore access to the internet.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Geographies of participation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Domain names are an important part of accessing information on the web. Domain names are a user-friendly way to find websites, as they rely on words that the average internet user can understand and recognize (such as google.com), rather than the string of numbers that makes up the IP address of every website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the paper, it is found that 78% of the world’s domain names are registered in Europe and north America. There is a wide range of the ratio of the number of internet users per domain name for each country. Some countries have very few users per domain name, meaning there are many domain names registered in that country with a relatively small number of internet users. For example, the US has approximately 3 internet users for each domain name, while other countries have more than 50 internet users for each domain name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This implies that most countries in the world would most likely use sites from countries with a very small ratio of domain names to internet users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important factor to consider is not only where information originates, but also where it is edited and expanded. GitHub is an incredibly popular collaboration service used primarily for coding purposes, which is used as the unit of measure for this section in the paper. As with other comparisons, north America and Europe make up the majority of GitHub users around the world. This is most likely due to the fact that most domain names are registered in these places, and therefore have many contributors who live there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wikipedia is a very well-known source of information, which can be added to and edited around the world. Many of the articles have been translated into many different languages, encouraging all users to make use of it and add to it. As with the previous two factors, significantly more edits were made in north America and Europe than other places.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Geographies of representation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Information isn’t exclusively affected by the location of internet users and their participation. Information is also about places, which can be written anywhere in the world about anywhere else. Countries are able to have a very low number of internet users, and a very large amount of information about it, and vice versa. This information can be about anything: places, landmarks, important people, and history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of google searches, there is a change in the pattern seen thus far. In some places with many internet users and higher participation rates, there are far fewer pages per internet user than some smaller countries which have very few internet users and lower participation rates. Many smaller countries can be a point of interest for internet users in other countries, leading them to search for these countries to find out more about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of marked roads and locations, the number of these elements follow the common pattern found thus far, with many more located in north America and Europe when compared to the rest of the world.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The paper concludes that there are uneven geographies of information, with far more representation and participation coming from the northern hemisphere. Contrary to expectations, the spread of the internet has made information geographies more uneven than before. The paper hopes to show that these uneven geographies need to be changed so that they are more balanced. This includes balancing the number of internet users and how they participate on the internet, as well as creating more information about places in less represented places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the diagrams shown in the paper, it is clear that the northern hemisphere , specifically north America and Europe, have significantly better information geography than other places in the world. There are more users, more affordable broadband, greater rates of participation, and more information about them than other places. Africa has on average the worst information geography in the world, with very few internet users, extremely expensive broadband, and low rates of participation. There are some exceptions though: some countries which otherwise have very little participation on the internet have a relatively higher number of webpages regarding information about them.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Suggested avenues for further research
                </h3>
                <p>
                    An interesting topic for further research could be to find out what methods are used in countries with better information geography in order to encourage internet users to participate online, and how they are able to provide broadband to users at such affordable rates. These methods could be compared to countries with bad information geography. Comparing these elements may be beneficial when trying to come up with a solution to balance information geographies around the world.
