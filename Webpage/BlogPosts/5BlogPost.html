                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a critical analysis of my UX and UI, in reference to various lectures throughout the semester as well as some additional research.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    UX
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My website was designed for PC first, with responsiveness in mind for when media queries were added for mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Landing/home page:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The structure of the page is very simple so as not to overwhelm users. A typical navigation bar is displayed at the top of the page, and remains visible at all times so that the user is always able to navigate to other pages. A footer with contact details is found at the bottom of the page. The body is made up of the title of the webpage, followed by a call to action [1, pg 11] by asking users to click on an icon. There are only 4 icons to choose from, so users would be able to select one relatively quickly. The icons are also quite large, drawing the user’s attention.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    About page:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I designed the about page to be an introduction rather than a focus point, so it only consists of a heading, avatar and description. I did not want to add extra unnecessary elements as I want the user to move on to the blog or portfolio sections, as they are the focus of my website.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Blog home page:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I completely changed the design for this page, as I felt like the article previews were getting lost in the page, and I didn’t feel a particular desire to click on any of the articles. I decided to use a grid to divide the different articles, as it clearly separated each one and made it easier to visually connect the title to the excerpt, which was difficult with the previous design. I made use of dark patterns to emphasize the buttons that link to the articles [2, pg 18], as the dark buttons are more enticing to the user than a simple blog title and excerpt. By keeping the excerpt short it is more likely that the user will want to click on the article to continue reading, rather than having a long-winded excerpt.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Blog pages:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The blog pages consist of the title of the article, the author (me), and the article itself, which is divided into various sections. Most of the articles have multiple subheadings, and at the end of the article a list of references is shown. I think that having these subheadings will help keep the user interested in what they are reading. Once a user starts reading an article, a back button appears in the top left-hand corner. The arrow is in a darker circle that matches the color of the navigation bar, which was done in an attempt to make the button more visible to the user.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Portfolio page:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The portfolio page makes use of a similar grid system to the blog homepage. Another call to action is included underneath the title of the page. The user is told some pieces of work contain videos of gameplay, which may entice users to stay on the page longer in order to see these videos. Each post consists of a title, a description of the piece of work shown, and at least one type of media to give the user a visual image of the piece of work. Pictures and videos are more likely to appeal to users, so by including a variety of them users are more likely to stay on the website for longer [3]. Buttons are used to load videos if and when a user wants to see them, and buttons encourage user interaction. The buttons are dark to draw the user’s attention. They also serve a more important purpose in this situation. Videos aren’t on the page when it initially loads, and only 1 video loads when a button is clicked which prevents longer loading times. It also gives a warning to users if the clip contains flashing/flickering lights, which allows users to skip a few clips if they are sensitive to these things, and not have them skip the entire page to avoid these sensitivities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although users are more likely to remember the first and last elements on a page [1, pg 8], I chose not to have a more important item at the end due to the number of portfolio pieces I included, as a user may lose interest before they reach the end of the page.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Style guide:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For the PC version of the website, the pictures and text alternate sides between each section. This is to prevent a wall of text on one side of the screen, or short paragraphs across the whole screen which end up only being a line or 2 long. Users don’t want to have to read large amounts of text, so by breaking it up into smaller chunks a user is more likely to continue reading.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    UI
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are various styling decisions made throughout the entire website. I chose blue as the site colour, as I find it gentle on the eyes, and it’s my favourite colour. I used a darker blue for the navigation bar and footer to tie my page together. The page the user is currently on is highlighted in the navigation bar by a light blue circle around it, which matches the main colour of the body of each page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose Verdana as the font for the website, since it is easier to read on screens than some other fonts [4]. To me it looks more modern than serif fonts, and because of this it seems more approachable while still being professional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used rounded corners on all the section elements and borders on the blog previews and portfolio pieces. I also used rounded buttons as I have a preference for them, and they come off as more friendly than buttons with sharper edges [1, pg 28].
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the home page I made use of 4 icons. I created the icons in a simple style. When positioning the items I noticed that 2 of them appear more dense, while the other 2 appear less dense. Because of the order that I wanted the pages in, I used this to create an asymmetrical balance between the icons by alternating between the less dense icons and the more dense icons [1, pg 17].
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my about page I included an avatar I created online since I am not comfortable being in photos, but I didn't want to just have a piece of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the blog homepage I changed my initial design, because having the title and the excerpt on opposite sides of the page made them feel disconnected. I changed my design to have 3 blocks, or articles, in a line when on PC with a full screen window. Each blog preview is surrounded by a dark blue border that matches the navigation bar, and a dark blue button that changes when the user hovers their mouse over it. The block has the title of the article at the top, an excerpt in the middle, and the button at the bottom. The excerpt is from the beginning of the article, and is designed to leave off mid-sentence to encourage the user to go to the blog page to continue reading. This is because users pay attention to incomplete things [1, pg 7], which in this case is an incomplete sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the portfolio page each portfolio item is outlined with the same blue border as the blog previews. The title or focus of the portfolio piece is included at the top of the block, followed by a description of the game or aim of the project. Depending on the type of portfolio piece, the block will end off with an image from the project, a clip from the project, Or a combination of both, and may have more than one of each item. The buttons to load the videos are the same style as the buttons used for the blog previews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the style guide page, the alternating of text and images when on PC not only breaks up the text into manageable chunks, it also creates a flow as you scroll down the page [1, pg 19].

                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I followed various UX and UI conventions when designing my web page. Some techniques I followed more than others, since ultimately it is my webpage, and I did what I thought would be best for it.
