                <h3>
                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Gender inequality is a big problem in today’s society, and this inequality appears in technological environments as well. A well-documented example is the inequality between men and women, but other genders experience other forms of inequality not often discussed, as they are often forgotten or left out entirely. I will be discussing some of the issues and inequalities experienced by women, and by extension gender non-conforming people.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Women in society
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Women have been fighting for equality for a very long time now, but there are still many people who oppose it. We live in a patriarchal society, as does the majority of the world. This means that men are and always have been in charge, and because of this power imbalance women are seen as inferior [3]. There are plenty of men, and women as well, who still believe that women should stay home, raise children, and do housework. Men are seen as the breadwinners, and women shouldn’t work unless the job is deemed appropriate and feminine enough for the people with these beliefs. When they see successful women or women in positions of power, lots of people think that they used their bodies to reach their position even though it’s almost a guarantee that they have worked much harder than their male counterparts. This imbalance means that far fewer women are successful in their fields, and aren’t as well recognised [4].
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Women in STEM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) fields have always been seen as masculine careers, and are thus male-dominated. In recent years the number of women in STEM has increased [5], but they still have to work significantly harder than men for the same (or lower) pay [1]. Whether consciously or not, these women are judged more harshly and treated as though they know less about their field than men of the same position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I saw a post recently about Lyndsey Scott, a woman who is both programming and modelling for a living [6]. It was mentioned that she knows 5 different programming languages, but the comments were full of men mocking her and doubting her abilities, clearly not having bothered to easily look her up online to see her accomplishments listed on her website. Her response to these comments mentioned the number of women who drop out of these fields due to hostile work environments. Even when women have the same experience and qualifications as men, they are often treated as imposters and shunned by male colleagues. Because of this type of environment the number of women in computer and programming related fields has actually been dropping since 1990 [5].
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Representation of women
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In a paper published [1] an interesting way of measuring representation was used. Instead of simply recording the number of women in computer sciences, their “impact” on their field is recorded. A set of 20 000 citations from each of a series of subfields was obtained to measure this ”impact”. Using AI to approximate the number of commonly male, female, gender-neutral or undefined first names from these citations, an approximate number of male and female contributors for each subfield was found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results show that female contributors make up less than 25% of the total contributors, and in 5 of the 9 subfields they made up less than 15% of the total contributors. This includes the contributors with gender-neutral and undefined names, but even excluding these names the numbers aren’t much better.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The concept of gender
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The meaning of the word ‘gender’ has changed over time. People used to use the words gender and sex interchangeably, but new research and human experience have shown that these are two different human characteristics which usually match, but in many cases do not. Gender is no longer the binary concept of man and woman. There are many people who exist outside of this gender binary, often referred to as non-binary or genderqueer people [7]. As a non-binary person myself, I have noticed many places where I feel excluded and forgotten, both in society and online.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Non-binary people in society
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Non-binary and gender non-conforming people are discriminated against on a daily basis (along with transgender people who do not “pass” – in other words, they do not look like a cisgender person of the same gender). There are a lot of people who do not believe in trans people, and say there is only male and female, which corresponds to man and woman. They deny the existence of anyone who does not fit their narrative, which is very invalidating. Other examples of discrimination are usually unintentional, such as male and female bathrooms, and addressing people as ma’am, sir, ms, mr, or some other variation, which we are taught are polite ways to address someone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time I am out in public and someone addresses me as ma’am or ms, I die a little on the inside because it reminds me that I am seen as a woman by society because I was born female. I avoid using public bathrooms because whenever I do I have to use the female bathroom because of my assigned sex. Clothing stores are separated into men’s and women’s sections. I know that these things have always been like this, and many people have minimal understanding when it comes to gender and the issues that come along with those outside the binary, but it still makes me incredibly uncomfortable. It took me a long time to overcome the fear of shopping for men’s clothes and being told I’m in the wrong section (and thank goodness I did, because having pants that have proper pockets was a welcome change). Gender neutral bathrooms on campus are a life-saver. The first time I entered the original game design building I hadn’t figured out my gender identity yet, but something about seeing the gender-neutral sign outside the bathroom made me feel relieved. The first time I went upstairs in the new game design building and saw the “humans” bathroom sign, I took a picture of it to show my friends, especially other non-binary people I know who aren’t able to publicly be themselves yet.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Non-binary people and technology
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Moving on from the bathroom rant, there are also issues faced online and for other forms of technology. As is detailed in a paper [2], the assumptions we make about people’s gender based on their appearance has carried over into technology as well. The author of the paper talks about the millimeter wave scanners at airports, and how uncomfortable situations arise when our assumptions combined with binary input systems result in many people being flagged as “anomalous” because their appearance doesn’t match the “body-shape data constructs” for the selected sex once their body has been scanned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thankfully I have not had to go through this process, and with my current presentation I most likely never will. I have noticed other places where non-binary people are excluded online though. Almost every time I need to select my gender, it only gives options for male and female or men and women. Sometimes there is a “prefer not to say” option, which I choose purely because neither of the other options are correct for me. There is a similar dilemma when selecting a title when filling out documentation or forms online. Even games aren’t immune to this exclusion: in games where you can customise your character you are given the choice between male and female characters, and you almost never get to choose which pronouns are used for your character (except for the standard she/her for female characters and he/him for male characters). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had some good experiences with games and gender. A story-based mobile game I play mentions “she, he, or they” and “his, her, or their” throughout the game when referring to a single person, and mentions people with genders outside the binary and people with different sexualities in multiple places as well. I am incredibly fond of the company now, because I had been playing and enjoying some of their other games when this new game was released, and my appreciation for them increased dramatically when I saw the level of representation included in the game (which is saying a lot because they created one of the smoothest, most well-balanced mobile games I have ever played). Another app I found recently is a self-care/mental health app with a cute baby birb (yes, birb is the word used in the app) friend to grow with you. You are able to choose pronouns for the birb from she/her, he/him or they/them, and there are items that show inclusivity, such as many of the different pride flags being featured on different items. Combining mental health awareness and inclusivity is a recipe for a great app in my opinion.

                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Women are greatly disadvantaged and underrepresented in STEM fields, more so than in other lines of work. They have to work harder for less pay, and deal with hostile work environments and belittlement. Their work has a significantly smaller impact on their fields based on research that compared the predicted genders of authors cited in other papers, and found that a much smaller percentage of contributors were female than those that were male.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Non-binary and gender non-conforming people are extremely underrepresented, both in society and technology. Most software is still programmed to work with the binary genders of men and women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This inequality and underrepresentation needs to be changed. Society as a whole needs to work on improving these things, but inequality will never truly be erased as long as there are those who do not see people of every gender as equal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People form their beliefs and prejudices when they are children and still learning new things. By teaching children that men and women are equal, and that gender is a spectrum and not all people fall under the gender binary, I think that they would most likely grow up being accepting and understanding of everyone and treating everyone equally regardless of gender. But children should not just be told these things. We need to start showing this equality in movies, games, books, and daily life in general, so that future generations see equality as normal, and not a right struggling to be earned.
